# Ateam-ember-supplement

This project serves as a bag for classes created to supplement ember.
 By definition this project is condemned to collect any "util" class adn grow beyond control. To prevent this, it's 
 necessary a continuous refactor to extract common functionality to external addons.

I create this as a mean to remove any non application specific class from the application code, with the intention
to analyze later if it should have its own addon.
